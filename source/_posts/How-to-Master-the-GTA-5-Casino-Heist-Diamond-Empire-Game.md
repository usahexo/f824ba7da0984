#  How to Make the Most of Your Diamond Empire Game Play

If you're like most people, you're probably spending a good amount of time playing Diamond Empire. After all, it's an incredibly addicting and fun game! However, if you want to make the most of your game play, there are a few things you can do.

First and foremost, it's important to understand the different aspects of the game. There are three main areas: the city, the mines, and the battlefield. The city is where you collect resources, train troops, and upgrade your buildings. The mines are where you find diamonds and other resources, which you then take back to your city. The battlefield is where you fight battles against other players.

To make the most of your game play, you need to focus on all three areas. You should start by upgrading your buildings in the city so that you can collect more resources faster. Then, focus on gathering as many diamonds as possible from the mines. And lastly, make sure you're training troops and arming them with the best weapons so that you can win battles on the battlefield.

Another thing to keep in mind is that it's important to be aggressive. Don't wait for others to attack you - go out and attack them yourself! This will help you gain more territory and resources, which will in turn help you improve your game play even further.

So if you want to make the most of Diamond Empire, be sure to follow these tips!
