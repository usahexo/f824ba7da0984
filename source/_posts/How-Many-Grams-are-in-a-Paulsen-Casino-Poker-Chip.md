#  Casino Poker Chips Weighing in at 1, 2, 5, and 10 grams

Casino poker chips have been around for a long time, and their weights have been standardized for quite some time now. The most common weights are 1, 2, 5, and 10 grams. Here we will take a look at the history and reasoning behind these weights.

The precise origin of casino poker chips is unknown, but they likely first appeared in the early 1800s in New Orleans. They were used as currency in private games among high-rollers. The first official record of casino poker chips was from a game in 1875 at the Saratoga Casino in New York.

At that time, the chips were made from bone, ivory, or wood. In 1895, celluloid began to be used to make chips, which was the precursor to modern plastic. It was not until 1937 that celluloid was replaced by bakelite, which is a type of plastic that is still used today.

The standard weight for casino poker chips has been 10 grams since the early 1900s. This weight was chosen because it is heavy enough to be easily handled but light enough so that large quantities can be carried around without too much fatigue.

Over time, other weights have been experimented with but 10 grams has remained the standard. Some casinos even offer custom weights such as 8 or 12 grams upon request from high-rolling players.

Although casino poker chips are most commonly used in games of Texas Hold'em and Omaha, they can also be found in many other casino games such as Blackjack and Roulette. And while the design of each chip may vary depending on the casino, they all weigh 10 grams and are made of plastic or clay composite materials.
