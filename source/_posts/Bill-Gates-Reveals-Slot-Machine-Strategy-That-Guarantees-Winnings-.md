#  Jetpack Joyride Pro Tip: Follow Bill Gates'Slot Machine Strategy

Years ago, Bill Gates was asked how he played slot machines, and his answer is still one of the best pieces of gambling advice out there.

"I always put in a dollar and play with 50 cents," Gates said. "That way I can't lose too much and I can afford to keep playing."

It's a simple strategy, but it's one that often works. By betting less per spin, you're decreasing your chances of losing money—but you're also increasing your chances of winning something back.

If you're looking for a similar strategy to use while playing Jetpack Joyride, here are three tips to follow:

1. Play on the lower levels. The higher the level you play at, the higher the stakes—and the more you can lose if you don't win. Start off by playing on the lower levels and work your way up as you get more comfortable with the game.

2. Bet less money per spin. This is another way to reduce your risk of losing money. If you're playing for real money, bet $0 .50 instead of $1 .00 or more. You may not win as much this way, but at least you won't lose as much either.

3. Use jetpacks and gadgets wisely. Some jetpacks and gadgets are better than others, so make sure you use the ones that give you the best chance of winning. For example, use the shield jetpack to protect yourself from obstacles and the boost jetpack to get ahead quickly.
