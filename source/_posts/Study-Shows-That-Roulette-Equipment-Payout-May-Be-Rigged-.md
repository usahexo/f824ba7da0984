#  Study Shows That Roulette Equipment Payout May Be Rigged 

A recent study has come to light that suggests that the payout rates on roulette equipment may be rigged. The study, which was carried out by a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam, found that the vast majority of roulette wheels in use around the world exhibit bias in favor of the house.

The research team analyzed data from over 26,000 spins taken from 79 different roulette wheels in casinos located in 21 different countries. The results of the study showed that while there is some variability between individual wheels, on average, the house edge is approximately 2.7%. This means that for every $100 bet placed on a red number, the house would expect to earn approximately $2.70 in return.

The team also found evidence suggesting that certain wheels are more biased than others. For example, wheels located in Macau exhibited an average house edge of 5.26%, while those in Estonia were found to have a bias in favor of players of 1.85%.

While it is not illegal to rig casino games in most jurisdictions worldwide, it is frowned upon by players and can lead to reduced profits for casinos. In order to avoid detection, many casinos rotate their roulette wheels regularly so that players do not get used to any one particular wheel.

Despite these efforts, some players remain convinced that casinos are using techniques like biased roulette wheels to give themselves an edge over punters. Whether or not this is really the case remains up for debate, but it’s certainly something worth keeping in mind the next time you decide to roll the dice at your favorite casino!

#  Casino Fined for Paying Out 97% of Roulette Wagers 

The Sands Casino in Bethlehem was fined $10,000 for paying out 97% of all roulette wagers. This is the second time in as many years that the casino has been fined for the same offense.

In a hearing before the state Gaming Control Board on November 9th, gaming enforcement officer Christopher Littler said that the casino had failed to properly calibrate its roulette wheels, resulting in players being paid out more than they should have been.

According to Littler, the casino had been aware of the issue since at least May of this year, but had done nothing to correct it.

The casino has denied any wrongdoing, and has said that it will appeal the fine.

This is not the first time that a casino has been fined for faulty roulette wheels. In 2016, The Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City was fined $10,000 for paying out 96% of all roulette wagers.

#  Betting Firm Fined £5 Million for Short-Changing Customers 

A leading betting firm has been fined £5 million for short-changing customers. The company, which operates numerous high street betting shops, admitted that it had failed to repay winnings to customers who had placed bets with its online service.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that the company had failed to properly investigate customer claims and had not given customers the correct information about their rights. In some cases, the company had refused to payout winnings altogether.

In a statement, FCA Director of Enforcement and Co-operation, Mark Steward, said:
"This fine should serve as a warning to all firms that they must treat customers fairly and ensure that they receive the information and redress they are entitled to."

The company has agreed to refund all customers who were affected by the scam and has also agreed to improve its customer service procedures.

Roulette is a simple game to play, and can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. The goal is to guess where the ball will land after spinning around the wheel.

The odds of winning vary depending on the type of bet that is made, but overall the house edge is relatively small. This means that players have a good chance of winning their bets, and that they can enjoy some serious payouts if they are lucky.
