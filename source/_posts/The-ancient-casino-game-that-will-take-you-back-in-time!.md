#  The ancient casino game that will take you back in time!

Do you remember playing the ancient casino game of roulette? If not, it's time to take a trip down memory lane and play this classic casino game that has been around for centuries! Roulette is one of the easiest casino games to learn and play, and it can be enjoyed by both novice and experienced players.

To play roulette, all you need is a roulette wheel, a table, some chips, and a player willing to take on the role of banker. The Roulette wheel has 36 numbered slots – 18 red and 18 black. A ball is placed in a spinning container at the opposite end of the wheel and when the ball comes to rest in one of the slots, that number is displayed on the wheel. The object of the game is to correctly predict in which slot the ball will land by placing a bet on that particular number.

The stakes for roulette can be high or low, depending on what you are comfortable with. Most casinos offer a variety of bets including Straight Up (betting on one number), Split (betting on two adjacent numbers), Street (betting on three numbers in a row), Corner (betting on four adjacent numbers forming a square), Six Line (betting on two streets), Dozen (betting on 12 consecutive numbers), Columns (betting on three columns), Odds/Evens (betting whether the next number will be odd or even) and Black or Red (betting on the colour of the next number).

There are also different types of wagers that can be placed including Inside bets (made at specific points on the layout) and Outside bets (made at areas bordering the inside betting area).

Once all bets have been placed, the croupier spins the wheel in one direction then launches the ball in the opposite direction around the circumference of the wheel. When betting "even chances" such as black/red or odd/even, players can only bet half their stake because there are 18 red slots and 18 black slots – giving each side an equal chance at landing.

Roulette has always been popular because it offers relatively good odds for players when compared to other casino games. It's also thrilling to watch the ball spin around before finally landing in one of those numbered slots! So pull up a chair at your nearest online or live casino and enjoy playing this exciting ancient casino game!
