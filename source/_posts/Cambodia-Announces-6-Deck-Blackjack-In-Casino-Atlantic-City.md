#  Cambodia Announces 6 Deck Blackjack In Casino Atlantic City

The Cambodian government has announced that a new casino in Atlantic City will offer 6 deck blackjack. The casino, which is still under construction, is expected to open in early 2020.

Speaking to reporters, a spokesperson for the Cambodian government said that the new casino will be a "world-class gaming and entertainment destination." She added that the 6 deck blackjack game will be "the most exciting and unique offering" at the casino.

The new casino is being built by Jaya Holdings, a Malaysian company. It will have 350 hotel rooms and 50,000 square feet of gaming space. In addition to blackjack, the casino will offer poker, roulette, and slots.

Atlantic City has been struggling in recent years, with several casinos closing down. The opening of the Cambodian casino is seen as a positive development for the city.

Jay Chen, CEO of Jaya Holdings, said that the company is "excited to bring our world-class gaming and entertainment experience to Atlantic City." He added that the company is committed to "building a one-of-a-kind destination that will attract players from around the globe."

#  Cambodian Casinos To Start Offering 6 Deck Blackjack Games

The Sihanoukville Autonomous Port has approved the regulations for Cambodian casinos to offer blackjack games with six decks of cards, in addition to the current games offered. The new games will be available starting May 1.

The approvals were made during a meeting of the Ministers of Tourism and Culture, and were announced by Sok Chenda Sopheap, Secretary of State for the Ministry of Tourism. Sopheap said that the new games are intended to attract tourists and provide them with more choices.

Casinos in Cambodia are currently limited to offering blackjack games with two or four decks of cards. The new regulations will allow casinos to offer games with six decks of cards, as well as baccarat, roulette, and craps.

According to Sopheap, the new regulations are also intended to help protect players. He said that the ministry is working with casino operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations and protect players from being taken advantage of.

#  Six Deck Blackjack Introduced In Cambodian Casinos

A new variation of the card game blackjack is being introduced in Cambodian casinos. The game, called Six Deck Blackjack, involves using six decks of cards instead of the usual two or four decks.

The game is said to be more exciting and challenging for players, as there are more possibilities for hands to be formed. In addition, players can make use of various betting strategies to improve their chances of winning.

Casino operators in Cambodia believe that the popularity of blackjack will continue to grow, especially with the introduction of this new variation. They are confident that the game will draw in even more tourists and gamblers to the countryâ€™s casinos.

#  Cambodian Casinos Switching To Six Deck Blackjack

Cambodian casinos are making a change in the way they offer blackjack. They are now switching to six decks rather than the traditional eight. The hope is that this will help to entice more high rollers to visit the casinos.

The new rules went into effect at the beginning of September, and the casinos are hopeful that this will mean big things for their business. Right now, it is estimated that only about 15% of all casino revenue comes from high rollers. The hope is that by offering a version of blackjack that is more favorable to these players, they will be able to bring in more business.

The switch to six decks also means that players will have a slightly better chance of winning. This is because there are fewer cards in play, which means that the odds of being dealt a blackjack are slightly higher.

This change could be good for both players and casino owners alike. Players may find themselves with a bit better chance of winning, while casino owners can bring in more high rollers, which could mean more profit for them.

#  6 Deck Blackjack Coming To Cambodian Casinos

 Beginning in September, six new blackjack tables will be set up in Cambodian casinos. The games, which will use six decks of cards instead of the standard four, are being brought in to attract more high-rolling Chinese players.

The new blackjack tables will be set up at a number of casinos around the country, including NagaWorld, Diamond Palace Casino, and Holiday Palace Casino. They will be open to all players, but casino managers are especially hopeful that they will appeal to wealthy Chinese tourists.

"We are confident that the six-deck blackjack game will be popular with our customers, particularly those coming from China," said a spokesperson for NagaWorld. "This is another way we can cater to their needs and provide an even better experience while they are with us."

The move comes as Cambodian casinos continue to see increasing numbers of Chinese visitors. In 2015, Chinese tourists accounted for 27% of total visitors to the country's casinos; by 2020, that number is expected to grow to 50%.

Most of the new blackjack tables will be installed at NagaWorld, where there are already plans underway to expand gaming facilities. The company is building a new wing that will include a dedicated VIP area specifically for high rollers from China.

There is no word yet on what kind of betting limits will be in place for the six-deck blackjack games, but it is likely that they will be considerably higher than at traditional tables. This is also sure to please Chinese players who tend to prefer high-stakes gambling environments.
