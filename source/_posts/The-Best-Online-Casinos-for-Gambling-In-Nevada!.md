#  Nevada Residents Can Now Gamble Online at Land-Based Casinos Too!

Nevada residents have always been able to Gamble online, but only at the state's numerous licensed and regulated online casinos. That has all changed as of September 1, 2019, however, as Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak has just signed a bill into law that allows residents to also gamble online at the state's land-based casinos.

This new law opens up a whole new world of gambling possibilities for Nevada residents, as they can now enjoy the convenience and comfort of gambling from their own homes, while also having the option of visiting one of Nevada's many brick-and-mortar casinos if they feel like taking a break from their screens.

The new law applies to all land-based casinos in Nevada, including those in Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. It does not apply to Indian reservation casinos, however.

Supporters of the bill say that it will help boost the state's casino industry by making it more convenient for residents to partake in gambling activities. They also note that it will help keep revenue generated by gambling within Nevada borders.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to an increase in compulsive gambling among residents and could put some casino employees out of work. They also claim that it will create an uneven playing field among Nevada's casinos, with those near population centers having a distinct advantage over those located in more remote areas.
