With finals looming on the horizon, Maltese students are finding all sorts of ways to liven up their classes. One popular game that is currently trending is called "Find Someone Who." The premise of the game is simple - each player pulls a card with a question on it and tries to find someone in the room who can answer the question. If they can't find someone, they have to ask a classmate. The game is a great way to get to know your classmates better and learn more about them.

Another fun game that has been gaining popularity in Malta recently is bingo. Students play by calling out numbers as they are drawn. The first student to mark off five numbers in a row (or any other pattern) wins the game. This game is perfect for classrooms with large groups of students, as it helps keep everyone engaged and entertained.

Both of these games are a great way to help students relax and have some fun during what can be a stressful time. In addition, they can help teach important skills like teamwork and problem-solving. So next time you're feeling bored in class, why not give one of these games a try?

On Tuesday, the 14th of November, a fun game of Find Someone Who Bingo was held in various schools around Malta. Throughout the day, many excited students participated in thisgame that encouraged socialising and getting to know new people.

The game was organised by the Youth Wing of the Malta Labour Party and it aimed to help young people become more acquainted with their peers from different schools.

#  Interactive Find Someone Who Bingo Brings Excitement to Maltese Schools

This year, the Maltese government introduced a new and interactive way of teaching social studies to students in primary and secondary schools. Called "Find Someone Who Bingo", the game is played in pairs or small groups, and encourages students to learn about one another's cultures, customs and traditions.

The game has been a big hit with Maltese students, who enjoy the challenge of finding classmates who can answer questions about their country and culture. Teachers report that the game has helped to improve students' teamwork skills, as well as their knowledge of Malta's history and culture.

"Find Someone Who Bingo" is based on the popular board game "Bingo". In each round of the game, one student reads out a question about Malta (e.g. "What is the capital of Malta?"), and classmates try to find someone who can answer it. If someone has an answer, they must quickly mark off that square on their bingo card. The first student to cross off all five squares on their card wins the round.

The game can be adapted for any topic or subject matter, and can be played with any number of students. It is perfect for use in the classroom, as well as for social events such as reunions or parties.

The game of bingo is one that is popular amongst Maltese students, with many enjoying its interactive and social nature.

There are a few different variations of the game that can be played, with each student having their own preference. One popular way to play bingo is by using a sheet of paper which is divided into squares, with each square containing a different task or question.
