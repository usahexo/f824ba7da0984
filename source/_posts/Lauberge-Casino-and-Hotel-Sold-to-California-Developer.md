#  Lauberge Casino and Hotel Sold to California Developer

On Wednesday, it was announced that the historic Lauberge Casino and Hotel had been sold to a California-based developer for an undisclosed amount. The property has been in operation since the 1920s and is one of the most iconic landmarks in the city of Baton Rouge.

The new owner, Sun Capital Partners, has plans to renovate and update the casino and hotel, which are both in need of significant repairs. The company also intends to add a new restaurant and spa to the property.

City officials are hopeful that the sale will breathe new life into Baton Rouge's struggling economy. In a statement released by Mayor-President Kip Holden, he said "This is great news for our city. The Lauberge is an important part of our history and we're excited about its future."

The Lauberge Casino and Hotel is just one of many downtown Baton Rouge properties that have been sold in recent months. Previous buyers have included hotel developers and a Catholic diocese.

#  Lauberge Lake Charles Sold to Nevada Company

Lauberge du Lac Casino Resort, the $440 million luxury hotel and casino complex in Lake Charles, has been sold to a Nevada company.

The complex was developed by Dallas-based Tesuque Gaming Holdings, which will retain a non-management role in the property. The new ownership group is led by Geoff Webb and Lance Gilman of the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center.

The resort will continue to be managed by Lakes Entertainment Inc., the same hospitality company that has managed it since it opened in 2007.

Webb said the new ownership group is committed to continuing the resort's high standards. "This is a magnificent property and we are excited about its future," he said.

The sale price was not disclosed, but industry observers speculated that it may have gone for close to $500 million. The acquisition includes the hotel, casino, spa, golf course, and other amenities.

#  Sale of Lauberge Lake Charles Keeps Going, Now Texas in Play

Lauberge Lake Charles, the luxurious resort and casino in Louisiana, has been sold again. This time, it’s going to a group from Texas.

The sale was announced earlier this week and is still awaiting approval from the gaming authorities. If all goes as planned, the new ownership will take over in early 2019.

This is the fourth time Lauberge Lake Charles has changed hands in the past six years. It was most recently owned by The Meruelo Group, who bought it in 2014 for $510 million.

No details have been released about the sale price, but it’s said to be in the billions of dollars. This would make it one of the largest casino sales in history.

The new ownership group is led by Dallas-based investment firm Presidio Group. Other members include two wealthy Houston businessmen and a Canadian entrepreneur.

Presidio Group already has a presence in the gaming industry, owning casinos in Colorado and New Mexico. They’re also developing a $2 billion casino and entertainment complex near Boston.

So what does this mean for Lauberge Lake Charles? It’s likely that there will be some changes under new ownership, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

The Meruelo Group made several renovations to the property after purchasing it, so we can probably expect more of the same under Presidio Group. That includes new restaurants, a spa, and additional gaming options.
