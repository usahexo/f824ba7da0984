# When do you receive bonus points?

This is a question that plagues many students during the school year. "When do I get my bonus points?" they wonder. The answer, unfortunately, is not always straightforward. In order to understand when you receive bonus points, it is important to first understand the grading system used by your school.

Most schools use a weighted grading system, which assigns different point values to different grades. For example, an A might be worth 4 points, while a B might be worth 3 points. This system allows for a more accurate depiction of student performance, as well as a more differentiated grading scale.

With this in mind, bonus points are generally awarded for above-average work. So, if you get an A in a class that is worth 4 points, you will earn 4 bonus points in addition to the 4 points for the A grade. If you get a C in a class that is worth 2 points, you will only earn 2 bonus points.

It's important to keep in mind that not all schools operate under a weighted grading system. Some schools use an unweighted grading system, which simply assigns letter grades with no point values. In this case, bonus points would not be awarded for any grades higher than the average grade in the class.

So, when do you receive your bonus points? The answer depends on your school's grading system and the individual teacher's policy on awarding bonus points. Always consult your teacher or school administration if you have any questions about how your grades are calculated and how bonus points are awarded.
