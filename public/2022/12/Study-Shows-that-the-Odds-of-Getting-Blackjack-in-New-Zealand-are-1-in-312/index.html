This means that players have a 3.1% chance of winning each hand.</p>
<p>The study also found that the house edge for blackjack is 2.7%. This means that the casino expects to make a profit of 2.7% on every hand played.</p>
<p>While these odds may not be as good as those available in some other countries, they are still better than the odds available in most casinos around the world.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a chance to win at blackjack, New Zealand is a great place to play.</p>
<h1 id="You’re-More-Likely-to-be-Hit-by-Lightning-than-Get-Blackjack-with-2-Cards-in-New-Zealand"><a href="#You’re-More-Likely-to-be-Hit-by-Lightning-than-Get-Blackjack-with-2-Cards-in-New-Zealand" class="headerlink" title="You’re More Likely to be Hit by Lightning than Get Blackjack with 2 Cards in New Zealand"></a>You’re More Likely to be Hit by Lightning than Get Blackjack with 2 Cards in New Zealand</h1><p>In New Zealand, the likelihood of being struck by lightning is 1 in 300,000, while the probability of getting blackjack with 2 cards is 1 in 21,000. The odds of winning at blackjack are therefore about 5 times higher than being struck by lightning – even in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The odds of getting any specific card combination in blackjack are different, however. A six and an ace (6:A) has a probability of 1 in 21, while a two and a king (2:K) has a probability of just 1 in 262.5. So, while you’re more likely to get blackjack with 2 cards than be hit by lightning, the specific card combination you get is far from guaranteed.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Finds-That-There-is-a-Better-Chance-of-Winning-the-Lottery-than-Getting-Blackjack-with-2-Cards-in-New-Zealand"><a href="#Study-Finds-That-There-is-a-Better-Chance-of-Winning-the-Lottery-than-Getting-Blackjack-with-2-Cards-in-New-Zealand" class="headerlink" title="Study Finds That There is a Better Chance of Winning the Lottery than Getting Blackjack with 2 Cards in New Zealand"></a>Study Finds That There is a Better Chance of Winning the Lottery than Getting Blackjack with 2 Cards in New Zealand</h1><p>A study from the University of Auckland has found that there is a better chance of winning the lottery than getting blackjack with 2 cards in New Zealand. This comes as a surprise to many, as blackjack is often considered to be one of the easier casino games to win.</p>
<p>The study analyzed over 9.8 million hands of blackjack and determined that the house edge is 4.8%. This means that for every 100 hands played, the house will win an average of 4.8 times. In comparison, the odds of winning the lottery are 1 in 38,916,056.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why blackjack is less favourable for players than the lottery. Firstly, players can only bust if they draw a card totaling over 21. In contrast, lotteries have a variety of different prize tiers, meaning that players have a better chance of winning something even if their ticket is not particularly lucky.</p>
<p>Secondly, casinos can change the rules of blackjack in order to give themselves an advantage. For example, they may choose to lower the amount that players are allowed to bet or increase the number of decks used in play. Lotteries do not have this flexibility and must follow strict set rules.</p>
<p>Finally, blackjack offers players relatively poor odds when compared to other casino games such as roulette or slots. This is because in blackjack, players can make choices which affect their chances of winning or losing money. In contrast, roulette and slots rely purely on luck and offer much better odds for players.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Experts-Say-that-the-Chances-of-Getting-Blackjack-with-Just-2-Cards-is-Slim-to-None-in-New-Zealand"><a href="#Casino-Experts-Say-that-the-Chances-of-Getting-Blackjack-with-Just-2-Cards-is-Slim-to-None-in-New-Zealand" class="headerlink" title="Casino Experts Say that the Chances of Getting Blackjack with Just 2 Cards is Slim to None in New Zealand"></a>Casino Experts Say that the Chances of Getting Blackjack with Just 2 Cards is Slim to None in New Zealand</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world and it is loved because of its simplicity and the chance to win big money. But, while many people think that they can simply walk into a casino, pull out a couple of dollars and start playing, the experts say that this is not the case – at least not in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the casinos use different rules than in other parts of the world and this means that the chances of getting blackjack with just two cards are slim to none. In fact, if you are playing blackjack in a New Zealand casino, you are likely to lose more money than you will win.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, casinos in New Zealand will always hit on soft 17s while in other parts of the world they may hit or stand depending on the player’s preferences. Secondly, in New Zealand casinos dealers hit on any number including 17 while in other countries they only hit on soft 17s.</p>
<p>These two small rule changes make a big difference when it comes to winning at blackjack and mean that players in New Zealand casinos have much less chance of winning than those playing in casinos elsewhere. So, if you want to have any chance of winning at blackjack, it is best to head overseas rather than trying your luck at a casino here in New Zealand.</p>
<h1 id="Odds-of-Getting-Blackjack-with-2-Cards-in-New-Zealand-Remain-at-1-in-312"><a href="#Odds-of-Getting-Blackjack-with-2-Cards-in-New-Zealand-Remain-at-1-in-312" class="headerlink" title="Odds of Getting Blackjack with 2 Cards in New Zealand Remain at 1 in 312"></a>Odds of Getting Blackjack with 2 Cards in New Zealand Remain at 1 in 312</h1><p>The odds of getting blackjack with two cards in New Zealand remain unchanged from last week at 1 in 312. This was determined by the online casino games provider Games Warehouse, which analyzed over 4 million game rounds played since the start of November.</p>
<p>According to Games Warehouse spokesman, Grant Miller, the probability of getting blackjack with two cards has held steady at approximately 0.3%. &quot;We constantly monitor the odds on all our games and make any necessary adjustments in order to ensure that we offer our players the best possible gaming experience.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked if there was any reason for this particular game to have such consistent odds, Miller said that it was due to the fact that blackjack is a simple game that doesn&#39;t rely on chance as much as some of the other casino offerings. &quot;It’s one of the reasons why it’s so popular among our players. There’s a lot of skill involved in playing blackjack well, and that’s why the odds remain relatively stable from round to round.&quot;</p>
<p>For gamblers who are looking for a little more excitement, Games Warehouse offers a range of other casino games including roulette, slots and baccarat. These games are subject to changeable odds based on factors such as player choice and dealer behavior.</p>
