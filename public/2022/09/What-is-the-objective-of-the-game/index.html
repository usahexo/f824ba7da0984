            <h1 id="What-is-the-objective-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-objective-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the objective of the game?"></a>What is the objective of the game?</h1><p>When you play the game, your objective is to score as many points as possible. You can achieve this by gathering crystals and then depositing them into the scoring areas. The more crystals you deposit, the more points you will score.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-play"><a href="#How-do-I-play" class="headerlink" title="How do I play?"></a>How do I play?</h1><p>To play, you need to use your arrow keys to move the character around the screen. You can also use the spacebar to jump. When you are next to a crystal, press the spacebar to collect it. then deposit it into the scoring area.</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-when-I-collide-with-another-object"><a href="#What-happens-when-I-collide-with-another-object" class="headerlink" title="What happens when I collide with another object?"></a>What happens when I collide with another object?</h1><p>If you collide with another object, you will lose a life. When you lose all of your lives, the game is over.</p>
<h1 id="When-do-you-receive-bonus-points"><a href="#When-do-you-receive-bonus-points" class="headerlink" title="When do you receive bonus points?"></a>When do you receive bonus points?</h1><p>This is a question that plagues many students during the school year. “When do I get my bonus points?” they wonder. The answer, unfortunately, is not always straightforward. In order to understand when you receive bonus points, it is important to first understand the grading system used by your school.</p>
<p>Most schools use a weighted grading system, which assigns different point values to different grades. For example, an A might be worth 4 points, while a B might be worth 3 points. This system allows for a more accurate depiction of student performance, as well as a more differentiated grading scale.</p>
<p>With this in mind, bonus points are generally awarded for above-average work. So, if you get an A in a class that is worth 4 points, you will earn 4 bonus points in addition to the 4 points for the A grade. If you get a C in a class that is worth 2 points, you will only earn 2 bonus points.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that not all schools operate under a weighted grading system. Some schools use an unweighted grading system, which simply assigns letter grades with no point values. In this case, bonus points would not be awarded for any grades higher than the average grade in the class.</p>
<p>So, when do you receive your bonus points? The answer depends on your school’s grading system and the individual teacher’s policy on awarding bonus points. Always consult your teacher or school administration if you have any questions about how your grades are calculated and how bonus points are awarded.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-special-feature-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-special-feature-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the special feature of the game?"></a>What is the special feature of the game?</h1><p>The first thing that you may notice about Fate Grand Order is the unique and detailed graphics.

<h1 id="What-are-the-different-symbols-in-the-game"><a href="#What-are-the-different-symbols-in-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What are the different symbols in the game?"></a>What are the different symbols in the game?</h1><p>There are various symbols in the game that players need to be aware of in order to play effectively. Some of these symbols are simple and easily understood, while others are more complex and may require a bit of explaining.</p>
<p>The most basic symbols in the game are the suit symbols. These are Hearts, Clubs, Spades, and Diamonds. These represent the four suits in a deck of cards. There are also number symbols, which range from 1 to 10. These represent the individual numbers on a card. The final basic symbol is the Wild symbol, which can stand in for any other symbol except for the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol is a special symbol that doesn’t have a specific meaning like the other symbols. Instead, it triggers a bonus round or payout when it appears three or more times on the reels.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol is another special symbol that can trigger different bonus rounds depending on the game you’re playing. For example, some games may award free spins or extra coins when the Bonus symbol appears.</p>
<p>Finally, there are several special Symbols that have unique meanings depending on the game you’re playing. For instance, one game might use an exploding volcano as its Wild symbol, while another might use a treasure chest. As such, it’s important to read through the rules of each game before playing in order to understand what each Symbol means.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play-the-game"><a href="#How-do-you-play-the-game" class="headerlink" title="How do you play the game?"></a>How do you play the game?</h1><p>The object of the game is to move all of your pieces around the board and capture your opponent’s pieces. The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>To move a piece, click and drag it to the desired location. A darkened square indicates where the piece can be moved. If a piece cannot make a legal move, it will light up red.</p>
<p>You can capture an opponent’s piece by moving one of your pieces so that it occupies the same square as an opponent’s piece. The opponent’s piece is then removed from the board.</p>
