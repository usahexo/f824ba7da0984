            <h1 id="5-Billion-Bet-on-Super-Bowl-LII"><a href="#5-Billion-Bet-on-Super-Bowl-LII" class="headerlink" title="$5 Billion Bet on Super Bowl LII"></a>$5 Billion Bet on Super Bowl LII</h1><p>The Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots are set to face off in Minneapolis for Super Bowl LII. While most of the focus is on the players, there’s another battle taking place off the field. The money is flowing in, with more than $5 billion wagered on the game.</p>
<p> Nevada sportsbooks have taken in more than $256 million in bets, with the vast majority of that being bet on the Patriots. Oddsmakers have New England as a 4.5 point favorite, but that number could move depending on how much money is bet on the game.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas sportsbooks have only lost once in the last 24 Super Bowls, so they expect to come out ahead once again this year. In fact, they’ve already raked in more than $19 million in profits from bets on the big game.</p>
<p>Despite all of the money being bet on the game, it’s hard to find anyone who actually knows who is going to win. The Eagles haven’t been to a Super Bowl since 2004 and they’re going up against a Patriots team that is looking for its sixth title.</p>
<p>It should be an exciting game and there’s sure to be plenty of action both on and off the field. If you want to get in on the action, make sure to head over to one of the Nevada sportsbooks and place your bets!</p>
<h1 id="810-million-wagered-on-NCAA-Men’s-Basketball-Tournament"><a href="#810-million-wagered-on-NCAA-Men’s-Basketball-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="$810 million wagered on NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament"></a>$810 million wagered on NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament</h1><p>$810 million wagered on NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, $330 million of which was illegally placed on the games. The figures are according to the American Gaming Association (AGA) as part of their effort to legalize sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>The AGA also said that they have commissioned a study that will be released in June that will show just how much tax revenue could be generated by legal sports betting.</p>
<p>“This data underscores what we have been saying for years – Americans are wagering billions on sports each year, and the current federal prohibition is failing miserably,” said Geoff Freeman, president and chief executive officer of the AGA.</p>
<p>“As we approach the height of basketball season and march toward the 2019 NFL season, it is more important than ever that Congress comes to a consensus on a path forward for regulating sports betting. This will create jobs, generate new economic activity and bring much-needed revenue to state and local governments.”</p>
<p>While $810 million may seem like a lot of money, it pales in comparison to some other forms of gambling. In 2017, Americans wagered $10.4 billion on casino slot machines and about $4.7 billion on poker games. Horse racing bets totaled $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The AGA has been lobbying for legalized sports betting for years now, arguing that it would be a boost to the economy. They claim that regulated sports betting would create up to 143,000 jobs and generate over $6 billion in tax revenue annually. But opponents argue that it would lead to more gambling addiction problems and increase crime rates.</p>
<h1 id="Mayweather-vs-McGregor-rematch"><a href="#Mayweather-vs-McGregor-rematch" class="headerlink" title="Mayweather vs. McGregor rematch?"></a>Mayweather vs. McGregor rematch?</h1><p>It would be no surprise if the rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor happened, as both fighters have expressed interest in it. It’s just a matter of when it will happen.</p>
<p>McGregor has already called for a rematch, but Mayweather says he is only interested if the money is right. “If we do fight again, it’ll be more about the money this time around,” Mayweather said in an interview with Fight Hype. “The first fight was strictly business. This time, we can give the fans what they want to see.”</p>
<p>Mayweather is currently retired, but he has been talking about a comeback recently. “I’m not coming back to lose,” Mayweather said. “I’m coming back to win.”</p>
<p>The two fighters are no strangers to each other, and they have had some heated exchanges in the past. The first fight was very intense, and there’s no doubt that a rematch would be just as exciting.</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-lose-big-as-Patriots-fall-to-Eagles-in-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Bettors-lose-big-as-Patriots-fall-to-Eagles-in-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Bettors lose big as Patriots fall to Eagles in Super Bowl"></a>Bettors lose big as Patriots fall to Eagles in Super Bowl</h1><p>Philadelphia, PA - The New England Patriots were favored by 2.5 points over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, but the Eagles came out on top with a final score of 41-33. This marks the second time in four years that the Patriots have lost in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Bettors who put their money on the Patriots are likely feeling disappointed this morning. According to ESPN, nearly 80% of bets placed on the game were placed on New England to win. In total, $138 million was wagered on the game, with over $100 million bet on New England.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Patriots have been favored in a Super Bowl and failed to come out on top. In 2015, they were favored by 2 points over the Seattle Seahawks but lost 28-24.</p>
<p>The Eagles are now 5-2 in Super Bowl appearances, while the Patriots fall to 5-3.</p>
<h1 id="138-million-wagered-on-NFL-Sunday"><a href="#138-million-wagered-on-NFL-Sunday" class="headerlink" title="$138 million wagered on NFL Sunday"></a>$138 million wagered on NFL Sunday</h1><p>The NFL’s popularity is undeniable, with millions of people tuning in every Sunday to see the best teams in the country compete. Fans love the sport for its strategy and excitement, and businesses love it for the money it brings in. On any given Sunday during the regular season, around $138 million is wagered on NFL games.</p>
<p>This number comes from a study by the University of Las Vegas, which looked at how much is bet on games at casinos in Nevada. The study found that, on average, $135 million is bet on NFL games each week, with Sunday seeing the most action. This week’s slate of games features some marquee matchups, including the New England Patriots against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys against the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>Fans can bet on a variety of different outcomes, including who will win the game, who will cover the point spread, and which player will score the first touchdown. Bettors also can wager on multiple games at once, making Sundays an especially busy day for bookmakers. In fact, some bookmakers have taken to calling it “Black Sunday” because of how much money is wagered.</p>
<p>Nevada is not the only place where people bet on NFL games. In fact, illegal gambling on sports is a multi-billion-dollar industry. But because of Nevada’s strict gaming laws, more information is available about how much is bet on NFL games in that state.</p>
<p>The popularity of the NFL shows no signs of waning, and with so much money at stake each weekend, it’s unlikely that will change anytime soon.</p>
