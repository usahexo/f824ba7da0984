The ads feature a number of celebrities, including boxing legend Muhammad Ali and social media star Jesse Wellens.</p>
<p>Ali is perhaps the most well-known of the bunch. The 72-year-old is a three-time World Heavyweight Champion and one of the most celebrated boxers in history. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 1984 but continues to work as a spokesperson and ambassador for the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center.</p>
<p>Wellens is also no stranger to the spotlight. The 35-year-old has over 2 million followers on YouTube, where he posts pranks, stunts, and occasional vlogs. His biggest claim to fame, however, is his work with co-host Jeana Smith on the popular podcast “The Jeana Show.”</p>
<p>Other notable actors include supermodel Naomi Campbell and comedian Dave Chappelle. Campbell is one of the world’s most successful models, with a career spanning more than 25 years. She’s appeared on over 500 magazine covers and has walked the runway for some of fashion’s biggest names, including Calvin Klein and Victoria’s Secret. Chappelle is a stand-up comedian and actor who rose to fame with his Comedy Central show “Chappelle’s Show.” He’s since starred in films such as “The Nutty Professor” and “Malcolm X.”</p>
<p>So far, the commercials have been well-received by fans and critics alike. And with an all-star cast like this, it’s easy to see why.</p>
